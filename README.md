# fileEncrypt
This program will encrypt and decrypt files, using a unique key/pass system to secure the file. Only the correct password can unlock/decrypt the file.

The purpose of this project is to eventually create a real life encryption for multiple situations like internet communication, files, secure auth keys etc.
